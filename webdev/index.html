<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This document has highly practical information and resources for you to learn about web using modern Project Based Learning(PBL) approch.<br>This document is not for exam clearing or passing point of view it is crafted for those who want to learn about the web using Agile Learning and hands-on projects. </p>
<p>You will be taken to the web from developer point of view.<br><strong>Theory is supported by relevent memes and illustations for ease of understanding.</strong></p>
<h2 id="What-is-Web"><a href="#What-is-Web" class="headerlink" title="What is Web?"></a>What is Web?</h2><p>Web is an Internet based system that serves the purpose of sharing resources from one computing device with other.<br><strong>Web</strong> in English means a network of interconnected elements. As we know many small computing devices are available on those devices and each node has specific value in the system to contribute to Internet. That is where Internet and Web seem similar.<br>Web works with many file formats but originally it was meant to avail readable files on internet which could be useful for others.<br>Today we use HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) with other modern technologies to bring a beautiful User Experience.</p>
<h2 id="Why-was-Web-needed"><a href="#Why-was-Web-needed" class="headerlink" title="Why was Web needed?"></a>Why was Web needed?</h2><p>When Internet started people wanted to share information and resources with other people using other computing devices but there was a problem that the computer or the device which servers the files has to be turned on all day and night for everyone to access specific resources which was not quiet possible with personal computers.<br><strong>Solution?</strong> Some tech businesses started to help people and other small business to bring themselfs by making going to your resources and info easily available to any body 24*7. They created services where people can buy some space to put their content on a system which is connected to internet all time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>IPv4<br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33034184/89873941-ca334d00-dbd8-11ea-8bdf-682d6cbb6f40.png" alt="image"></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>You can study about IP Addresses from other resources but for now just know that IP Address is behind each active domain.</strong></p>

Websites work with https:// (Port 443) or http://(Port 80) domains but under the hood websites communicate with APIs or Websockets to fetch data and resources from other services also.<br><strong>All the smart phone apps that we use communicate with a server which is hosted on the Web using Domain which has server IP.<br>That is how we can access same data over the Phone Apps or Web-based apps as the Server is not client side dependent any type of device can ping server if the developers want.
</strong></p>
<h2 id="What-is-Client-Side"><a href="#What-is-Client-Side" class="headerlink" title="What is Client Side"></a>What is Client Side</h2><p>Client Side is anything that pings the website and uses it. User uses Website using Client like Web-browsers from various available devices.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Server-Side"><a href="#What-is-Server-Side" class="headerlink" title="What is Server Side"></a>What is Server Side</h2><p>Anything that happens related to logic of the service or the backend it is done on the server side.</p>
<h2 id="Where-is-Programming"><a href="#Where-is-Programming" class="headerlink" title="Where is Programming"></a>Where is Programming</h2><p>There are different programming languages for various purposes in Web Dev and some do fulfill<br>many purposes.<br><strong>Client Side Progamming</strong><br>HTML and CSS are just the Structure and Design parts of Website which cannot be considered as programming laguages as we donot write logics in HTML and CSS.</p>
<p> They are in simple words controlled by JavaScript to function in intractive manner.<br><strong>Laughter Warning !</strong></p>

<p>JavaScript is the language which executes in user’s browser to provide the functionality to smooth and interative websites.</p>
<h2 id="Server-Side-Programming"><a href="#Server-Side-Programming" class="headerlink" title="Server Side Programming"></a>Server Side Programming</h2><p><strong>Programming logic and business logic of a site resides on Server Side. Server Side Programming languges are</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PHP </li>
<li>Java(Spring Boot)</li>
<li>Python (using Django or Flask Web Dev<br>Frameworks) Note: Python Frameworks can also manipulate client side pages. <ul>
<li>NodeJS<br>These languages help the developer write the logic for backend or server side.<br><strong>Note that Backend languages can be used for building API’s for your project too.</strong> </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-is-Server"><a href="#What-is-Server" class="headerlink" title="What is Server"></a>What is Server</h2><p>Server serves the desired Webpage or API for users. Server is nothing but a port that runs and serves what the Developer has coded.<br><strong>If you are a developer, You will be working simulating the server on your local machine to develop the desired functioning of server.</strong></p>
<h3 id="Where-is-server-kept"><a href="#Where-is-server-kept" class="headerlink" title="Where is server kept"></a>Where is server kept</h3><p>Server itself is a specifically configured Computer/PC usually runs on Linux OS and can also run Windows or Mac but practically Linux is useful and widely used, now server has a port opened for public to access it’s resources.</p>
<p>Server is a running service on a port of an IP address which allows web traffic to use it’s resources.</p>
<p><strong>What is Port and opened port</strong><br>This is an important element of servers and website.</p>
<p><strong>Port</strong> :<br>Computers do <strong>not</strong> have ports.<br> Think of it as a virtual place which is available for specific service. If you want to access files on the web you go to port 443(https) or 80 (http) traffic. If you wish to run a database on the server you will be given a 3306 Port Number in case of MySQL.<br>There are total of 65535 Ports available on a system/PC’s Networking Layers.<br><strong>Opened Port:</strong> The networking protocols like TCP and UDP need the source and destination port to send data to specific service. </p>
<p>Port is always assigned with IP address for Network devices to identify sender and reciever.<br>General Format to hit a IP at specific Port<br><strong>IPADDRESS:PORT (192.168.90.255:5005)</strong><br><strong>Try This</strong><br>[<a href="https://www.google.com:80/]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com:80/]</a><br>This is Google server’s port 80 means http means the we are hitting the google IP@ Port 80.<br>Google has configured their server to not use port 80 as the data is not secured over port 80.<br>You can read about difference between http and https from the web in case and know how https is secure.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33034184/89976334-c8739300-dc85-11ea-90c9-09138ae70e70.png" alt="web dev 101" title="Web dev" width="300" height="auto"></p>
<p><strong>Now Test This</strong><br>This is where our google request is served. Port 443 open for HTTPS request/traffic<br>[<a href="https://www.google.com:443]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com:443]</a><br>(<a href="https://www.google.com:443" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com:443</a>)<br>By Default Modern Browsers take us to PORT number 443 to achieve https but if we donot have https enabled in our site/server browser then tries port 80 and shows we are using unsecured connection.<br><strong>More on this will be discussed in coming steps.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loads normal Google</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why 65535 Ports to be specific</strong></p>
<p>The concept of “ports” is strictly related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TCP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UDP</a> protocols of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TCP/IP networking stack</a>. From a strictly technical point of view, both TCP and UDP are structured in such a way as to carry several kinds of information (Source port, Destination Port, Sequence Number, Data, etc.). As both “Source port” and “Destination port” are structured (within the TCP and UDP packet) with a 16 bit “field”, here are the limits: source ports and destinations ports can assume all the values that can be represented with 16 bits (aka: from 0 to 65535);</p>
<p><strong>0 to 65535 ‘cause they are both represented with a 16 bit value.</strong></p>

Linux machines are available to use as provided by hosting providers at different costs and machine hardware configurations like RAM and storage.<br>Linux hosting is not the only option as mentioned earlier but for now keep it to linux. </p>
<p><strong>Does that mean you need hosting to start building your website?</strong><br>No, not yet!</p>

The only difference in your personal computer and Hosting service machines is that it is up all day and night with stable internet connection until you can pay .<br>Your personal Computer can be your server till the time you can keep it turned on.</p>
